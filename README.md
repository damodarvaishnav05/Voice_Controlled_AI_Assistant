🎙️ Voice Controlled AI Assistant



📘 Introduction

This project is a Voice Controlled AI Assistant developed in Python. It recognizes human speech, processes commands, and performs various automated actions like opening websites, telling jokes, managing notes, playing music, and controlling system functions such as shutdown, restart, or locking the computer.
It aims to simulate a simple personal assistant similar to Alexa, Google Assistant, or Cortana, using open-source tools and Python libraries.



🧠 Abstract

The Voice Controlled AI Assistant listens to voice input, converts it to text using SpeechRecognition, and executes commands accordingly. It can interact with multiple web services, perform local system tasks, and even take spoken notes.
By combining speech recognition, text-to-speech, and automation modules, this project demonstrates how AI can be integrated into daily computing tasks through Python.
